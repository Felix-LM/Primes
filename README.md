# Primes
A small project I completed! I was trying to make a program that continuously finds prime numbers.
The algorithm.py file is the actual code that finds primes, and the interpreter simply copies the primes found up until it is run to a separate .csv file.
If you want to use this code yourself, make sure to initialize it by writing "1" and "2" on separate lines in the primes.csv file!
